# CSE 503
Some projects about _CSE 503S Rapid prototype development and creative programming_ at WashU. It is the first time when I talks to the web development. The most exciting part for this class was not about how useful the software I developed could be, but the great (torturous) time when I made progress with my friend from scratch (spent a lot of time though). In addition, the UI style looks good :)
