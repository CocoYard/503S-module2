## Release

<a href = "http://ec2-18-223-97-39.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/~Yong/fileSharing/login.html">Link</a> to the file sharing website. Codes are waitting for uploading.

## Login account name:

```users.txt``` is under the directory ```/home/Yong```, which cannot be accessed by users.

## Creative Portion

- Files of any user are sorted by modified time.  
- Extend the maximum uploading size to 20 MB.
- Display the size and the modified time for every file. For sizes, it will change to the most appropriate unit(B, KB, MB). 
- When successfully or unsuccessfully uploaded or deleted a file, it will count down from 5 seconds then back to the main page showing all files. Of course, you can back in advance by click the ```back``` link.
- Previewing is not always compatible with all types of browser, especially for mobile end. So we added ```downliad``` option for users.
- The preview icons will switch with respect to types of files.
