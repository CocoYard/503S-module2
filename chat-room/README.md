# CSE330/503S

## Some Notes

```
1.  User names and room names should be unique.

2.  Every account is disposable. When logged out or refreshed the page, this user name cannot be used anymore.
    Then you should use another user name.

3.  But all chat histories related to that user are kept.
    
```
